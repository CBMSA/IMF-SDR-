    <h2>What Are Special Drawing Rights (SDRs)?</h2>
    <p>Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) are international reserve assets created by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to supplement the official reserves of member countries. The SDR is not a currency but a potential claim on the freely usable currencies of IMF members.</p>

    <div class="highlight">
      <strong>Note:</strong> SDR value is based on a basket of major currencies (USD, EUR, CNY, JPY, and GBP).

  <section id="allocation">
    <h2>SDR Trust Allocation Facility</h2>
    <p>The IMF allocates SDRs to member countries in proportion to their IMF quotas. These allocations provide liquidity, bolster reserves, and reduce reliance on more expensive domestic or external debt.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Used to stabilize balance of payments and debt servicing.</li>
      <li>Supports emergency response and macroeconomic recovery.</li>
      <li>Available for direct issuance into central bank reserves.</li>
      <li>Can be exchanged for freely usable currencies with IMF approval.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Member State Access</h2>
    <p>IMF member countries can access SDRs via their central banks or ministries of finance. The allocation process is conducted transparently, and countries are expected to use SDRs prudently to support resilience and development.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Eligible institutions must be listed with the IMF's central depository.</li>
      <li>Onboarding requires verification of monetary authority status.</li>
      <li>Usage must be reported under the IMF's guidelines.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section id="faq">
    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <p><strong>1. Are SDRs a currency?</strong><br/>No, SDRs are not a currency. They are an international reserve asset and a unit of account.</p>
    <p><strong>2. Can SDRs be traded?</strong><br/>Yes. SDRs can be exchanged between member countries for freely usable currencies with IMF facilitation.</p>
    <p><strong>3. How is the SDR value calculated?</strong><br/>It is based on a weighted basket of five major currencies and updated daily by the IMF.</p>
    <p><strong>4. Who can receive SDR allocations?</strong><br/>All IMF member countries automatically receive SDRs in line with their quota share when allocations occur.</p>
